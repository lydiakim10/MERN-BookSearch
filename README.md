Once the user is signed in, the user can simply type in a book title that they wish to search for and the API will render all of the different books available according to the search. The search will show the user the book title, author, description, image, and so much more! From here, the user an click to "Save this Book!" and add it to their collection. If a user wishes to view their books that they saved, they can click the "See Your Books" tab on the top right corner and it will display all of the books the user has saved. If there is a book in the saved list that the user wishes to delete, the user can click the "Delete this Book!" button and the book will delete from the saved books page.
